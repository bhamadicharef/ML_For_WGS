Theory-guided Machine Learning for Water-gas Shift Reaction Optimization

Description:
Here, we provide XGBoost, ANN and Ensemble codes to validate our 10-fold cross-validation performance reported in the article: J. Chattoraj, B. Hamadicharef, J.F. Kong, M.K. Pargi, Y. Zeng, C.K. Poh, L. Chen, F. Gao, T.L.
